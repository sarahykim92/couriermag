==========

When you're working on this project locally (ie. on your computer) then you need to:

1. Open the terminal
2. type ``cd /Users/sarahykim92/Documents/couriermag`` and hit enter (this changes the terminal to the project folder)
3. type ``bundle exec middleman server`` and hit enter (this starts a little server that runs on your computer)
4. goto http://0.0.0.0:4567/ in your browser!
5. yey

Then, to 'build' the project (so it's ready to go to the internet), do the following:

1. Open the terminal
2. type ``cd /Users/sarahykim92/Documents/couriermag`` and hit enter (this changes the terminal to the project folder)
3. type ``middleman build`` and hit enter (this creates all the static files for the project and puts them in your dropbox folder)
